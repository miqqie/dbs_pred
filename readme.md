#Chatbot App

<br> Building a simple Flask API to predict DBS share price based on SGD-USD exchange rates, as well as incorporating simple chatbot functions via Groq. 

It is an example of how a linear regression model can be deployed to generate output based on the user's inputs. 

It also shows the possibility of pulling replies from different LLM models (e.g. Llama and Deepseek) based on the user's query.

You can access the app here: https://dbs-pred-kds3.onrender.com
