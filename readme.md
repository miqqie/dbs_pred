## Chatbot App

Building a simple Flask API to predict DBS share price based on SGD-USD exchange rates, as well as incorporating simple chatbot functions via Groq. 

It is an example of how a linear regression model can be deployed to generate output based on the user's inputs. 

It is also able to pull replies from different LLM models (e.g. Llama and Deepseek) based on the user's query.

## Base Code Provided

The base code that was provided in the course can be found here: https://github.com/miqqie/dsat-ft1

## Improvements Made

Several improvements were made to the base code including: 

1. Changing the colour scheme and adding a robot image for a more aesthetically pleasing interface. 
2. Adding a page that allows for the simultaneous display of replies from both Llama and Deepseek for the user's query.
3. Formatting the replies to make them more readable e.g. (removing the verbose enclosed in <think></think> from Deepseek's reply to make it more succinct)
